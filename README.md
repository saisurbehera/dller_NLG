Temporal embeddings for the retreival blocks. 

Our world is dynamic and the nature of text on the web is constantly changing. In recent years, we have seen a wide-scale adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most LLMs are trained with static snapshots of knowledge bases. LLMs are not only very computationally expensive but are prone to the semantic shift of existing tokens and the sub-optimal and failed understanding of new tokens. To overcome these challenges in this paper, I in- troduce the Dynamic Large Language modEl with Retrieval (DLLER). We augment the current state-of-the-art methods (Hombaiah et al.,2021) that rely on sampling methods and incremental training with weighted retrieval blocks.
